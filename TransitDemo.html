		<h2> Census2020 Transit Service Areas </h2>
		
		<h3>Census data helps to inform where new bus routes should go!</h3>
		<p>
			Thanks to insight from Pierce Transit and King County Metro, we know that census data is used to 
			find areas where residents might benefit from a new bus route. Census data helps to find areas with high 
			a higher liklihood of benefiting from public transit access. Specific details that they look for inclide (but are not limited to): 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Senior Citizens</li>
			<li>Youth</li>
			<li>Disabled Persons</li>
			<li>Household Vehicle Access</li>
			<li>Low Current Transit Usage</li>		
		</ul>
		
		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Finding New Service Areas</h3>
		<p>This map displays layers of census data. Turn the layers on to find areas where all demographic details intersect. These areas might be ready for new transit routes!</p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;">What if Someone Fills out the Census Wrong?</h3>
		<p>
			If only 8% of people living in a specific census block incorrectly listed their vehicle access, the map looks much different.
			<strong>Less than 100 people</strong> didn't report or incorrectly reported their car ownership status, and now the bus might not 
			come to this South Hill neighborhood.
